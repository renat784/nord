    <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

    <mat-expansion-panel>
      <mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <mat-panel-title>
          Can I buy NordVPN in retail stores?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        Yes, you can get the NordVPN physical box on Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and
        <a [routerLink]="['/retail']">other retail stores.</a>
        For more anonymity, buy it in a brick-and-mortar store and pay in cash.
      </p>
    </mat-expansion-panel>

    <mat-expansion-panel>
      <mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <mat-panel-title>
          How do I upgrade my plan?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        You can upgrade your VPN plan at any time. To do that, simply visit your
        <a [routerLink]="['/retail']">user profile</a>
        , click on the Pick a Plan button and select the subscription plan you like. The upgrade period will start
        after your current subscription ends.
      </p>
      <p>Just don’t forget to cancel the recurring subscription to avoid being charged twice.</p>
    </mat-expansion-panel>

    <mat-expansion-panel>
      <mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <mat-panel-title>
          Do you accept PayPal?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        PayPal is no longer available as a payment option for our service. But no worries here – we accept major credit
        cards, cryptocurrencies, AliPay, WeChat, and many other payment methods.
        However, note that we cannot grant refunds if you purchased the NordVPN app through the App Store – you will
        have
        to contact the store support for that.
      </p>

        <mat-panel-title>
          Can I use the app overseas?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        Yes, you can use NordVPN when traveling. It will help you stay safe on unsecured wireless networks and keep
        access
        to the content and sites you’re used to. We also offer an obfuscated server option for countries that restrict
        VPN
        usage. Please check our Help Center for further instructions on
        <a [routerLink]="['/retail']">how to use the obfuscated servers.</a>
